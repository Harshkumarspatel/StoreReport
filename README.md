### Data Sources
The primary dataset used here is a excel file. Which contain detail of sales by the store over one year.

### Tools
- Excel - for data cleaning, analysis and to create report

### Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring sales data to answer following questions:
- What is the sales of the store by month?
- Which state contribute most to the store's sales?
- What is the channel of the order, gender and age of the customer?

### Data Analysis and Results
Using Excel Pivot table feature the data converted to pivot table. After that various charts and visuals were generated according to the requirement.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend following actions to the store:
- During the winter time the sales gets decreased, so store can bring some additional winter wears to attract more customers during that period.
- Moreover, store can add some new men's collection to attract more male customers.
- Apart from Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart which contribute 80% of total sales, they can consider to add more customer through other small contributing channels to diversify their presence.
